						<b>Ingredients:</b><br>2 pounds boneless pork belly, 1½ inches thick, cut into 3-inch-long slabs<br>1 large red or yellow onion, quartered <br>8 garlic cloves, crushed<br>4 dried bay leaves<br>3 tablespoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more as needed<br>1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns<br>1 tablespoon soy sauce<br>Vegetable oil, for frying (about 4 cups)<br><br><b>Recipe:</b><br>1. Cook the pork: Place the pork, onion, garlic, bay leaves, salt, peppercorns and soy sauce in a large pot. Add enough water to cover the pork by about 2 inches. Partially cover with a lid and bring to a boil over high. Reduce to medium and cook at a lively simmer until the skin is fork tender, about 45 minutes. If desired, drain the broth and reserve to use as stock.<br>2. Dry the pork: Heat the oven to 275 degrees. Place a wire rack on a sheet pan (you can line the sheet pan with parchment or aluminum foil for easier cleanup); place the pork on top. Pat the pork with paper towels. Grab a handful of wooden skewers, and evenly puncture the skin. (Alternatively, you can score the skin every ¼ inch.) Season both sides generously with salt. Place in the oven until the skin is completely dry, 1 to 1½ hours.<br>3. Prepare the vinegar sauce: In a small bowl, add the vinegar, garlic, chiles, 1 teaspoon salt, black pepper, to taste, and soy and fish sauces, if using. Stir until the salt is dissolved.<br>4. Fry the pork: Fill a deep wok or Dutch oven with about 1½ inches of oil, and heat to 370 degrees over medium-high. Using tongs, place one slab, skin side down, in the hot oil. Stand back just in case there’s excess moisture trapped in the pork; it might splatter. Fry until the pork is golden brown and the skin is crisp and bubbled, about 6 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain the temperature. Carefully flip the pork and fry the meat side, continuously ladling oil over the skin, until it takes on a little color without drying out, 1 to 2 minutes. The skin should be crispy and the meat should be tender and juicy.<br>5. Remove the lechon kawali and return it to the wire rack to cool slightly. Repeat with the remaining pork slabs. Once cool enough to handle, chop the fried pork into bite-size pieces.</td></tr>

						<b>Ingredients:</b><br>1 tablespoon (15ml) canola oil or other neutral oil<br>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken legs, separated into thighs and drumsticks (about 2 1/2 pounds; 1.15kg)<br>8 garlic cloves, crushed<br>Kosher salt<br>8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced<br>2 whole fresh bay leaves (or 3 whole dried bay leaves)<br>1 1/2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns<br>1 1/4 cups (300ml) water<br>1 cup (240ml) soy sauce<br>1 cup (240ml) rice vinegar<br><br><b>Recipe:</b><br>1. In a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Blot chicken dry with paper towels, then season lightly all over with salt.<br>2. Working in batches if necessary, add chicken pieces to pot in a single layer, skin side down, making sure not to overcrowd the pot. Cook until well browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken pieces and cook until lightly brown on the second side, about 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.<br>3. Add garlic, bay leaves, and peppercorns to now-empty pot and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is very fragrant and garlic turns a light golden color, about 30 seconds. Add water and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the pot. Add soy sauce and vinegar, return chicken pieces to pot, increase heat to high, and bring liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked through and tender, about 20 minutes, turning the chicken pieces halfway through.<br>4. To Serve: The chicken is best served after sitting overnight in the refrigerator, but it can also be served immediately, with steamed white rice or (preferably) garlic fried rice. The chicken pieces can also be briefly broiled before serving.<br>5. To Broil Chicken Adobo: Adjust oven rack to 6 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Transfer chicken pieces to a paper towel–lined rimmed baking sheet and blot surface with more paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible; discard paper towels. Arrange chicken skin side up on the baking sheet and broil until chicken skin is crispy and lightly charred, about 2 minutes (keep an eye on the chicken to ensure it does not burn). Serve immediately with steamed white rice or (preferably) garlic fried rice, passing adobo sauce at the table.</td></tr>
